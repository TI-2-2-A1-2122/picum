Until God prevents this at the last minute and orders an animal to be sacrificed. This is a difficult story. Is this about religious insanity? this reassurance because God ultimately want love? Does this indicate the son\'s love for his father? The Sacrifice of Isaac by Menashe Kadishman portrays the Bible story with all the cruelty, vulnerability, madness, supremacy. How I wish that this story did not exist, that there was no madness but only love.\"\"\"</string>

Whoever grabs a beer on a terrace on this delightful square in the summer will soon discover (even without that beer) that this square offers the best view of the large tower of the Grote Kerk. From this spot you can also admire the beautiful wide substructure of that tower. There is a lot to see in this square. On the left on the corner of Havermarkt and Reigerstraat you will see the house \'De Arent\', built around 1490.
